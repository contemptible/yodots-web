    <p>If you're an avid moviegoer, chances are you've amassed a collection of ticket stubs at some point, either purposefully or by chance. You've probably also come across rogue stubs during cleaning binges, stubs that remind you of special experiences at the movies that you had almost forgotten. Wouldn't it have been great to have one unified place to store those memories instead of stuffing them in a drawer?</p>
    <p>Now you do!</p>
    <p>YODOTS is your online drawer of ticket stubs, a site designed to store information about all of the movies you see in one convenient location! If you're tired of worrying about your collection, <a href="#/register">register now</a> and move it all online!</p>
