<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>If you're an avid moviegoer, chances are you've amassed a collection of ticket stubs, either purposefully or by chance. You've probably come across rogue stubs during cleaning binges, stubs that remind you of special experiences at the movies that you had almost forgotten. Wouldn't it be great to have one unified place to store those memories instead of stuffing them in a drawer?</p>
